Hi, I'm a Lead EUC Engineer at Target in Minneapolis, MN. My typical day is centered around delivering the Windows OS to 70K endpoints scattered across the globe and managing one of our XenDesktop VDI environments. Currently I'm one of the leads for rolling out Windows 10 to the enterprise. Our scale demands automation and my favorite automation tool is PowerShell, but occasionally I've been known to write a batch script or two. On the side I'm working on a WebAPI to integrate with SCCM to help facilitate automating the initiation of workstation builds.
